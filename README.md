# 🎨 AI Image Classifier – Streamlit App

This project is a simple AI-powered image classification web app built using Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
Users can upload an image, and the app will tell them what objects are inside the image using a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNetV2).

# 🚀 Features

Built entirely with Python

Upload JPG or PNG images

Resize and preprocess images automatically

Classify images using MobileNetV2 (ImageNet 1000 classes)

Show the top 3 predictions with confidence scores

Clean and interactive Streamlit interface
